    lovegov:    A distributed computational machine for facilitating democracy, which loves you.

    topic:      Our principle way of categorizing content; a division of politics by the issues.

    content:    The stuff of lovegov. It appears in group feeds and is constantly being created and shared
    by our users.

    --  question:       You answer it to express your views.

    --  poll:           A set of questions grouped together.

    --  petition:       An official petition cannot be edited once finalized. When you sign a petition you
        are publicly saying that you support the issues raised by that petition.

    --  discussion:     All content on lovegov has discussions connected to it, but you can also create discussions
        on their own, starting with a self-post or by sharing a link to a news article. Discussions
        are forums for talking about the issues, and seeing what your fellow voters have to say.

    --  legislation:    A bill passed by Congress. Lovegov provides tools for tracking and navigating legislation so
        that you can see the the primary source on what's actually happening in Congress.

    --  motion:         A suggestion that a democratic group take a certain action. This could be adding a new moderator, removing
        an old one or joining a colation. Motions go into effect as soon as they receive a threshold number of upvotes from
        members of the group in question.

    upvotes:    By clicking the plus heart on a piece of content, you are affirming that you think this content
    is important and that other people should see it. This doesn't necessarily mean you agree with it, but when
    you upvote content it moves up the group feeds and is more likely to have a bigger reach.

    downvotes:  The exact opposite of upvoting, by clicking the minus heart on a piece of content you are pushing
    a piece of content down the feed and away from view.
