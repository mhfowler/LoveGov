    <p>Hi {{ user_profile.first_name }},</p>

    <p>
       Here is our last weekly digest email before election day.
    </p>

    <p>
        We know you have probably been bombarded with phone calls and people knocking at your door, but here is a friendly non-partisan reminder to
        go out and vote.
    </p>

    <p> Also if you haven't tried our
        <a href="http://lovegov.com/match/presidential/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">presidential matching</a> check it out before tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island or New Hampshire
        <a href="http://lovegov.com/elections/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">see how you match with the candidates running in your congressional district and senate races</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        We hope we provided
        useful tools for you this election season. After tomorrow LoveGov will be transitioning to focus on local politics
        and legislation - stay tuned, the most important part of the political process is yet to come. Many thanks for your support. Love,<br><br>
        The LoveGov Team
    </p>
