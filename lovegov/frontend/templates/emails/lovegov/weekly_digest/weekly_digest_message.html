    <p>Hi {{ user_profile.first_name }},</p>
    <p>
        Here is our fourth weekly roundup of questions and news that we think you might like.
    </p>

    <p>
        Catch the last Presidential debate tonight at 9PM EST and participate in our <a href="http://lovegov.com/discussion/331271/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">live discussion</a> of the debate.
    </p>

    <p>
        LoveGov T-Shirts are now available at <a href="http://teespring.com/lovegov" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">http://teespring.com/lovegov</a>. We wish we had enough money
        to give everyone a T-Shirt for free, but for now all we can do is make them available at cost.
    </p>
