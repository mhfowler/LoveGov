    <p>
        The alpha update is now up! We have added a number of new features including comparisons to your congressmen, networks,
        and all LoveGov users; petition creation, signing, and discussing; article linking; and a feed of content that users
        have created. The site is starting to take shape and with summer rolling around and a growing team we will be
        accelerating development in the next few months as we prepare for a general release before the election.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please come back, check out our new features, and give us some more feedback. We hope you like what we've made!
    </p>

    <p>Love,</p>
