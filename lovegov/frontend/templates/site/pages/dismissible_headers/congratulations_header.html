                You finished checking out all of our getting started ideas and won't be seeing these
                headers anymore.

                But LoveGov is much more than just
                figuring out who you match with. We're trying to put politics online and grow a community
                of politically engaged citizens who demand that the political system be improved for the
                modern era.
            </p>
            <p>
                Share news, track legislation, poll the community and sign petitions. As more politicians take notice of what we're
                doing we hope to get them on LoveGov as well so that you can follow them closely and
                interact with them directly.
