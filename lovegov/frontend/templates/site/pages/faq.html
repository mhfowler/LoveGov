<div class="faq-question">

<h2>Where does the LoveGov poll come from?</h2>

<p>We wrote all of these questions based off of the principle elements of legislation that were recently voted on in Congress.
</p>

<div class="faq-question">

<h2>How do you generate matches?</h2>

<p>Matches are based on which answer you gave and how strongly you weighted the question.
There’s no mysterious formula that generates a magic number. The formula is,  </p>
    <p>
 total weight of questions both users answered the same divided by total weight of questions both users answered = match %
    </p>
    <p>
    We generate answers for presidential
candidates and congressmen based on our own research of their voting records and their stated opinions. Right now only the views
        of the presidential candidates and congressmen from RI, MA, NH & CT are researched by hand. The views
        of the rest of Congress are determined by parsing voting records from a legislation database and answering our questions
        based on their ties to legislation. This doesn't totally capture a politician's views, but we hope that as LoveGov grows politicians will start to take notice,
        eventually claim their profiles on LoveGov, and answer our questions themselves.

<div class="faq-question">

<h2>How does privacy work?</h2>

<p>It’s simple: we will never sell your personal information. You’re in complete control over whether people can 
see your information, activity and answers. There are two modes of navigating LoveGov: public and anonymous. 
In public mode, everyone can see what you’re doing. In anonymous mode, when you post a piece of content or make a comment,
other users see “Anonymous” as the creator and it will not be attributable to you. If you’d like to keep your views 
to yourself, use the site in anonymous mode.</p>
<p> Please keep in mind that any features relating to communications with elected officials cannot be used anonymously.
This includes sending messages to representatives and signing petitions, but may apply to other features in the future.  </p>

<div class="faq-question">

<h2>You’re asking me to login with Facebook. Doesn’t that contradict your privacy policy?</h2>

<p>Nope. Facebook doesn’t get any information about your activity on LoveGov except that you chose to login.
    Logging in with Facebook means that we can automatically provide you with matches to your representatives, school and geographical networks, and friends.
    Again, we promise to never sell this information. We just use it to simplify your experience.</p>

</div>

<div class="faq-question">

<h2>Are you partisan?</h2>

<p>No, we don’t represent either side of the aisle.
    LoveGov is a platform where all views have equal access to tools and the community.
    Take a look at our mission statement to see more about our commitment to non-partisanship, government transparency, and the right to individual privacy.</p>

<h2>I am part of a political campaign/organization. How do I use LoveGov?</h2>

<p>We’ve designed our matching so that most of the work is done for you. Rather than go out looking for
supporters, they’ll find you instead. You just need to create a group, get all your members to join, and make sure everyone
fills out their questions thoroughly. This will make it easy for people to find you. If you are a politician, go to your 
settings and fill out the politician section so that you can run for elections. </p>

<p>To rally people around your cause you need to actively make use of our group features: share news, conduct surveys,
make scorecards, highlight legislation, have discussions and create petitions. Soon people will also be able to register to vote,
    find their polling location, and donate to campaigns. </p>

<p>We’d really appreciate your feedback. Drop a line to our Head of Outreach, Alex Marcus, at <a href="mailto:alex@lovegov.com">alex@lovegov.com</a>, so that we can better understand how to meet your needs.</p>

<div class="faq-question">

<h2>What does the future look like for LoveGov?</h2>

<p>Good question. These days we’re focusing on our core features, but eventually we’d like to become a true political social network and one-stop shop for politics.
    We want people to be able to manage their entire political lives, federal through local, in one place.</p>

<p>Imagine a place where you can find out when and where all elections are, who is running, and how you stack up against the candidates.
    You can read the news, understand what legislation actually means, track voting records, and talk to your representatives.
    You’ll be able to find organizations and causes, donate to them, and participate in their initiatives.
    LoveGov will be the place where you sign petitions for the president, but you’ll also debate which roads to fix with members of your community.
    With each new issue, you’ll respond to surveys alongside millions of other Americans expressing your view: the people have spoken, and politicians won’t have a choice but to listen.</p>

<p>Yeah, we know that building a political social network sounds grandiose and difficult, but that’s the vision. And obviously, it won’t be possible without your help.
    We believe that the American people want and need LoveGov, and that together we have the ability to change politics.</p>

<div class="faq-question">

<h2> How does the heart system work? </h2>

<p>
    Our heart system is how our users ensure highest quality content rises to the top: up-hearts promote content, down-hearts demote it.
    This is not about agreeing or disagreeing with content, but about acknowledging what is interesting, informative, or well said.
    Every user also gets a heart score at the top of their profile. They get one heart for every answered question and for every upheart their posts get.
    Politicians also get uphearts for every supporter they have and for every bill they introduce.
</p>

<div class="faq-question">

<h2>
    Why is LoveGov for-profit and how will you make money?
</h2>

<p>
    We think being for-profit gives LoveGov a better chance of succeeding. Our goal is to build the best political website
    in the world, and we don't want to be distracted by frequent fundraising efforts. We want LoveGov to be able to sustain itself.
</p>

<p>
    We are aware of the concern that money could corrupt LoveGov. This is why we place our
    mission front and center; we are committed to non-partisanship, government transparency and the right to individual
    privacy. This mission always comes first. Any deviation would be a betrayal of the democratic process
    and completely undermine our credibility.
</p>

<p>
    Currently we have no revenue because we are entirely focused on building a platform for our users. Eventually,
    we will make money by charging a fee for donations, targeted advertising, and accessing aggregate data.
    It is important to keep in mind here that no personal information will ever be sold and ads will be clearly demarcated.
</p>

<p>
    Something we are very excited about is that our ads will actually be useful for small and local level
    campaigns. Based on how they answer questions and where they vote, user will get ads tailored to them specifically. 
    For the first time, instead of mass messages, politicians will be addressing the specific issues you care about.
