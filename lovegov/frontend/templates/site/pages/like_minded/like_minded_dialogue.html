                    When you click the update button, we clear your current like-minded group and recompare you with every single other user on LoveGov.

                    When we find a user who shares 15 responses with you and is at least 75% similar, we add them to your group. Unfortunately...
                    comparing you to every other user takes a while, so please be patient after you click update. If you keep the above dialogue
                    open while its calculating, you can see how many people get found out of every 100 checked.

                    We update this group every night, so as you answer more questions you will find more like minded people here.
