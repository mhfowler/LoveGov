<p><h2>Campus Liaison</h2></p>

<p>Young politicos are the foundation of LoveGov. Our matching mechanism and group tools are perfect for student groups to
recruit members, coordinate their efforts, take action, and promote their cause. We need you, the campus liaison,
    to get your school's student groups on LoveGov, and through them, the student body. 
    We are looking for campus leaders that are passionate about the LoveGov cause. </p>
<p> A large part of your job will be
to speak directly to student group leaders, explaining how to use LoveGov, and getting them active on the website. 
Campus-wide initiatives are the best way harness the energy of multiple student groups. You will have to be creative
and persuasive in coordinating these groups and doing guerilla marketing. Whether these initiatives are based around 
local campus/city issues, the elections, or international causes, this will have to be organic. LoveGov is a
platform for facilitating people's existing political passions, not forcing new ones. </p>
<p> Throughout, you will also be in contact with the other campus liaisons to see what groups/causes are gaining 
traction. We want to get inter-campus initiatives started around the election, the lame duck session
and the presidents first 100 days. The goal is to have several national, student led campaigns that actually gain
media attention enable our generation to have a meaningful impact the legislative debates. If you are interested in being a liaison, please contact <a href="mailto:alex@lovegov.com">alex@lovegov.com</a>.

    a difference in the way our country works? You might be a good fit for us. We’re looking for someone who’s both
