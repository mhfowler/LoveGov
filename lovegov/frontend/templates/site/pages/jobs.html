<p>We’re always looking for more help, so if you think you can contribute to the cause, please get in touch.
    Enthusiastic, hard-working and friendly people are very important to us. We work closely together as a 
        team, and everyone has input into the development of the product and rollout strategy. Please direct 
        general inquiries to <a href="mailto:joschka@lovegov.com">joschka@lovegov.com</a> (CEO)</p>

<p>Specifically, we are looking for two more developers and an army of campus representatives. </p>
<p> Developers, you must have experience with one or multiple of the following:
Responsive Web Design, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, MySQL, and/or server administration. Contact <a href="mailto:max@lovegov.com">max@lovegov.com</a> (Lead Developer) </p>
<br>Campus Representatives, you must be deeply involved in the politics/activism on your campus. Contact <a href="mailto:alex@lovegov.com">alex@lovegov.com</a> (Director of Outreach)</br></p>


<p><h2>Campus Representative</h2></p>

<p>Young politicos are the foundation of LoveGov. At the core of service is the ability for groups to
recruit members, coordinate their efforts, take action, and promote their cause. We are focusing on college student 
    groups as the primary avenue into these young, politically active communities. We need you, the campus representative,
    to get all the political student groups on LoveGov, and then through them, the entire student body. </p>
<br> We are looking for leaders. Already knowing the leaders on campus is important, but what really matters is that
you are excited about and devoted to the LoveGov cause. Creativity is also key. There are many ways groups can use our website,
and there are just as many ways that you can get the word out there, or even start a campuswide initiative. Contact Alex for more information. </br></p>

<p><h2>Front-end Developer</h2></p>

<p>Do you write poetry in jQuery? Does IE 6 give you gangreen? Want to use your front-end badassery to actually make
    a difference in the way our country works? You might be a good fit for us. We’re looking for someone who’s both
    passionate about creating change and writing pretty code. Work collaboratively with our (friendly) designers to
    implement mock-ups and make the LoveGov experience beautiful, engaging, and fun.
    We’re also looking to start improving mobile optimizations, so any experience with that is definitely appreciated.

<p>We’d prefer you have experience with some of the following:
<ul>
    <li>Responsive web design</li>
    <li>HTML & CSS (we use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>)</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Knowledge of Python and the Django framework is a huge plus</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p><h2>Back-end Developer</h2></p>

<p>Optimization! Component Modularity! Distributed Systems!</p>

<p>Do you eat databases for breakfast? MySQL — more like MyCereal.</p>

<p>Find your amateur bonsai collection winning awards because you have so much free time because you finished
all of your coding already? Do you enjoy writing code on your computer? Come help build the platform for politics of the future.</p>

<p>Preferred experience:
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Django</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Some front-end experience (CSS, javascript)</li>
<li>Some server administration experience</li>
</ul>
