    <div class="contributor-description">
        <p>
            As a founder, Clayton played a pivotal role in the early formation and construction of LoveGov. His diverse background
            was instrumental in developing and connecting ideas, code, design and politics. Together with Max and Catherine, he helped
            build the first few major iterations of the website including, among many other things, authoring the entire user interface,
            visual comparisons and integration of political and legislative data. Indeed, he poured his heart and soul into LoveGov,
            and without him, he would never have gained initial traction. After working with us for nearly a year, Clayton departed
            LoveGov to attend to personal matters.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the founding principles of LoveGov, Clayton believes in the power and importance of bringing people of
            various perspectives together to address, discuss and solve conflict and that through communication and compromise,
            mutual understanding and respect of divergent viewpoints is achievable. We owe Clayton many thanks for all his contributions
            and wish him the very best in his future endeavors.
        </p>
