The views.py file contains functions that generates dynamic content

The urls.py attaches dynamically generated pages from views.py to corresponding urls on the site.
    Example: (r'^zero/$', iterate_num)
             r: iterates regular expression
             ': starts/ends string
             ^: require regular expression matches the start of the string
             $: require regular expression matches the end of the the string
             Note: there is no "/" before "zero" because it is assumed one will be present in the regular expression matching
             iterate_num : function called from views.py to generate page sent to user upon going to

The views.py is where functions are defined that generate the page with the dynamic content.

The templates folder contains .html files.

You will not be able to access attribute fields of forms in the templates (i.e. {{ login_form.username }} unless in
the view method generating the page the form object is instantiated at least once without ".as_p()" or ".as_table()".
This doesn't make any sense and is completed nonsensical.
